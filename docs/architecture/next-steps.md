# Next Steps

1. **Approve this architecture document** (verifies understanding of current state)
2. **Begin investigation phase** (determine exact error when clicking "Scan QR")
3. **Implement fix** based on root cause findings
4. **Test across browsers** per PRD requirements
5. **Deploy** and verify in production environment

**Architecture Integrity**: All fixes must maintain the current technical constraints:
- 100% client-side (no backend)
- Offline-capable
- Security model unchanged
- Existing libraries only (no new dependencies)
