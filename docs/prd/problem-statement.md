# Problem Statement

## Current State
- QR scanner button exists and is integrated into the security model
- Implementation is complete but broken (likely ES6 module loading issue)
- Users must manually type private keys, which is error-prone and frustrating

## Impact
- **Usability**: Manual entry of 51-52 character keys causes errors
- **Security**: Typing increases shoulder-surfing risk vs. quick scan
- **User Experience**: Non-technical users may abandon the tool
